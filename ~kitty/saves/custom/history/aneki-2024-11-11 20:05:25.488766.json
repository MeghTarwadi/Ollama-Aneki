    "content": "prepared.In binary (base-2), which uses only two digits '0' and '1', the sum of 1000 (8 in decimal) and 217 (109 in decimal) can be calculated as follows:\n\nFirst, write down both numbers in binary form:\n```\n  1000     (+8 in decimal)\n+ 1101101\n---------\n```\nHere we've written the number 217 with five bits (including one for carrying if needed). Notice that I added an extra bit on top of '217'. This is because when adding binary numbers, you must align them by their least significant bit. Here are both aligned:\n\n  01000     (+8 in decimal)\n+ 01101101    (with leading zeros to make it five bits like the first number for alignment purposes.)\n---------\nNow perform binary addition, starting from the rightmost digit and moving leftwards. If you're dealing with two '1', remember that they sum up to '10'. Write down \u20180\u2019 in your result column (just as if we deal with decimal numbers) and carry over a 1 into the next higher bit:\n```\n  01000    <- aligned input number (+8), first three digits are ignored since our second binary doesn't have them.\n+ 01101101     (which is +217, added leading zeros)\n---------\n     01000  \n      11011    <- carry over '1'. Next column:\n          110    <- continue carrying if necessary... In this case we have nothing left to add. All the remaining digits from 217 are carried and written down, giving us a result of five bits with an extra one for overflow (carry-out):\n```  \nSo in binary form: `11111101` which equals '153' or eleven hundred fifteen if converted back into base ten."
