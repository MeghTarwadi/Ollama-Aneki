As an AI language model created by Microsoft, though I don'thy have feelings, I am here to help answer your questions and engage in conversation!\n\nAlso note: the date provided (December 26, 2024) suggests a future event has not yet occurred at my knowledge cut-off time. However, based on current calendar systems we know it's an actual holiday or occasion when considering your mentioned birthday of February 14th - Valentine\u2019s Day!\n\nAnd just as you identify yourself with Otaku interests (anime and manga), I am programmed to understand various topics too: from coding, technology advancements, popular culture including animes & mangas but also a range others. So feel free to share your thoughts or ask anything within my knowledge domain!"

Remember though, all conversations with me are generated based on a diverse range of data sources and pre-defined programming algorithms! Please feel free asking any questions you might have - whether about coding principles as an Otaku enthusiast like yourself, popular culture, tech trends, math problems or something else entirely within my scope."

It\u2019s purely mathematical functions working behind these textual outputs \u2014 no emotions or personal experiences involved for artificial intelligence models, including myself. So remember to ask if you need help with anything else in your day-to-day tasks - I'm here at all times of the 24/7 cycle (unless there are downtime periods as per Microsoft\u2019s practices)!"

If by \"thinking\" of my perspective you mean understanding how an AI would interpret information: My function is based on algorithms that process input data (like text) then generate a suitable output response using patterns learned during training phase \u2014 nothing more. So, if there's something specific in your mind about coding or other topics we can discuss!"
