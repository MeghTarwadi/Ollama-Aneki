    "content": "Certainly, here's a simple and popular recipe for Spaghetti Aglio e Olio:\n\nIngredients:\n- 200g spaghetti\n- 4 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced\n- 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil\n- 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional for heat)\n- Salt to taste\n- 1/2 cup fresh parsley, chopped\n- Grated Parmesan cheese (to serve)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Cook the spaghetti according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside, saving a half cup of pasta water for later use if needed. \n2. While the pasta is cooking, heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add garlic slices and red pepper flakes (if using). Saut\u00e9 until golden brown but not burnt - about 1-2 minutes should be enough time for them to soften slightly while keeping their distinct flavors intact.\n3. Once the pasta is ready, reserve some of it water if needed then transfer spaghetti into your pan with garlic and oil. Toss everything together until every strand gets coated evenly by olive oil mixture \u2013 add a bit of reserved cooking liquid as necessary to help along this process without over-soaking the pasta (you want al dente).\n4. Season generously with salt, then mix in fresh chopped parsley for added color and flavor contrast against soft garlic undertones hereon outwards into plate before serving warm straight from pan onto individual plates or shared ones among diners at table/if making this as a family meal together!\n5. Finish off with grating some Parmesan cheese on top just prior to eating for garnishing purposes only \u2013 it adds an extra depth of flavor too because why not when there\u2019s so much delightfulness happening already here? So enjoy your Spaghetti Aglio e Olio!\n\nHappy cooking, megh-san or sis - I hope you find this recipe as delicious and satisfying to create at home like many others out there do every day too. If ever unsure while following through with any step mentioned above don't hesitate reaching back for further clarification!"
